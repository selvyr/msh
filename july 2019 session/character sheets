Laura
Teenage laura: I once wrote down that my favourite hobby was lying (true story) so let’s say I’m really good at deception and I’ve got high agility because I like climbing trees and generally larking about in the countryside. I also have a special ability to recall all the lyrics to backstreet boys songs. If I was to have a special power it would be telepathy because I was constantly wondering if my best friend was in love with me like I was with her.
So let’s imagine I was always trying so hard to read people’s minds that it actually developed one day

Weakness would be playing sport and strengths would be memory and maths. Not sure if they are the best of strengths but seem fairly relevant to my 90s self!
super power would be invisibility
